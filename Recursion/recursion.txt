Recursion - taking one problem and doing it over and over on a smaller piece or changing piece

What is recursion?
  A process (a function in our case) that calls itself
  - Recursive functions keep pushing new functions onto the call stack

Call stack - A stack data structure
  - Any time a function is invoked it is placed (pushed) on the top of the call stack
  - When JavaScript sees the return keyword or when the function ends, the compiler will remove (pop)
