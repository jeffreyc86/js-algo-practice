Improve Problem Solving by Mastering Programming Patterns

Frequency Counter Pattern
    - This patter uses objects or sets to collect values/frequency of values
    - This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations

Multiple Pointers Pattern
    - Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, middle, or end based on a ertain contition
    - Very efficient for solving with minimal space complexity
